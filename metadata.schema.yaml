  # ------------------
  # Allow identification of basic aspects of the document.
  # Included in PDF metadata through LaTeX and ConTeXt.
  # Note that if you just want to set PDF or HTML metadata,
  # without including a title block in the document itself,
  # you can set the title-meta, author-meta, and date-meta variables.
  # (By default, these are set automatically, based on title, author, and date.)
  # The page title in HTML is set by `pagetitle`,
  # which is equal to the `title` by default.
  # Additionally, any root-level string metadata, not included in ODT,
  # docx or pptx metadata is added as a custom property.
