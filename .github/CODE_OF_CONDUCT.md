# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment for scholarly
communication, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation
in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of academic background, experience level, education, disability,
personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the scholarly community
* Showing empathy towards other community members
* Providing proper attribution and citation of others' work

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Plagiarism or misrepresentation of others' work
* Other conduct, which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional academic setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to
temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors that they deem
inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an
appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project maintainer at shorodilov@gmail.com. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
